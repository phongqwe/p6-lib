message-api:
  Principle design:
    IPython context:
      - IPython context handle and manage connections to IPython instances.
      - It can start, stop IPython instance
      - It provides objects that relying on the validity of the connection, such as:
          - connection file info
          - session info
          - channel provider
          - message sender provider
          - message encoder
          - message id generator
    Objects provided by the context must NOT be directly created manually
    
  Exceptions propagating, handling:
    - Exceptions should be returned as Result<> object instead of throwing directly.
    - Each type of error should be represent by a unique class of Exception. This choice allow any kind of class of Exception containing any type of data in any structured be returned to exception handlers.
