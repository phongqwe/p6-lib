    /**
     * suspending vs blocking:
     * suspending = blocking a coroutine, but not the underneath thread
     * blocking = block the underneath thread.
     *
     * A normal function is a blocking function. A suspend function only block a coroutine.
     * =====
     * suspend function and coroutine. I must not mix-up these two concept.
     * Coroutines are a block of code that can be run asynchronously.
     * suspending functions are function that can block/pause/suspend coroutines.
     * =======
     * Coroutine builders (launch, async) run things in a suspend functions.
     * So when creating a suspend function, I should ask the question: is the logic require waiting.
     *
     * I don't really need to write suspend function in order to use coroutine.
     *
     * - Coroutine deal with asynchronous code (code runs in parallel)
     *
     * - suspending function deal with waiting code.
     *
     * Most of the time, coroutine is invoke asynchronously because it involves waiting code. But they (coroutines) do not necessarily serve only such purpose.
     *
     * Since suspending function is for waiting/blocking code. It is best that they are used within coroutine so that they don't block the UI thread.
     * =====
     *  the point of suspending function is: they can literally block (suspend) coroutines . The rule of suspending function is that they must be called within other suspending function.
     *
     *  This is because suspending function use some kind of compiler code generation in the background to generate continuation-passing code.
     *
     *  Why should data, business logic layer expose suspend function to handle waiting logic ?
     *      Answer:
     *          - I want to run my waiting logic inside coroutine so that it only block the coroutine and don't block the underneath thread. In order to block the coroutine, I must use suspending function
     *          - So that I don't have to use callback and let my code be written in direct style
     *  ======
     *  Since suspend function only run inside suspend function, and suspend function always start with coroutine, I must only make something suspend function if I plan to use it inside an inherited coroutine.
     *  For class that don't use inherited coroutine, but injected coroutine, I can use normal function.
     *  Rule for injected coroutine scope:
     *      - for services: inject coroutine scope as object properties
     *      - for multiple-purpose crap: inject in function parameter. But this is rare. For now this is only used in IOPub listener. This listener is supposed to run both as background services, and one-time object. This is bad, and should not be be exposed to external use.
     *      - for one-time blocking such as network call or long computation, use inherited coroutine scope
