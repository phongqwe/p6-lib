    contains code to communicate with zmq of ipython
  Principle design:
    IPython context:
      - IPython context handle and manage connections to IPython instances.
      - It can start, stop IPython instance
      - It provides objects that relying on the validity of the connection, such as:
          - connection file info
          - session info
          - channel provider
          - message sender provider
          - message encoder
          - message id generator
          - services:
              - heart beat service:
                  - ping heart beat channel and receive liveness signal from heart beat channel
              - iopub listener service:
                  - listen to publication from iopub channel
    Objects provided by the context must NOT be directly created manually
    Services and system events:
      - Service should only work in ideal condition. They can handle certain edge cases that are within their power, but MUST NOT handle cases related to system events (such as kernel interruption). They must be designed in away so that they are capable of react to system events, but the trigger of such reaction is done externally, in classes that are responsible for handling system-level events.
      - Cases:
        - kernel interruption:
          - Kernel interruption is handled by service hub/controller or the context. Services should have a clear abstraction (one or more functions) to handle this. But the trigger of such contraption resides in the hub/controller/context.
      - Consequence of this design:
          - this design lead to the fact that if I forget to handle system event in the hub for certain services, they will stuck in a confusing state.
          - Eg:
              - MsgListener run in a infinite loop and processes msg as they come. When the kernel is interrupted, but the hub/controller/context does not do command MsgListener to do something (such as restart), the MsgListener will continue to run its infinite loop
      - Justification of this design:
          - Aside from services that are in charge of watching system events, This responsibility does not belong to other services, and making them aware of such services internally will lead to injecting a whole lot of uncessary thing into them, bloating the services up, and violate separation of concern/single responsibility principle.
          - So the safe way to make them (the non-system-event services) aware of and be able to react to events is to let the event-watcher services trigger the non-wacher services.
    Service and coroutine:
      inherited coroutine vs injected coroutine:
        - pick injected coroutine
        - services by their nature, run in their own forever loop. If I use inheritted coroutine scope, I may start then this way:
            coroutineScope{
                launch(Dispatchers.Default){ service.start() }
            }
            Because the service run forever, the job containning it will not return, and this prevent coroutineScope from returns and hang the entire app.
            Therefore, for services that run forever, I have only one approach: injected coroutine scope
  Exceptions propagating, handling:
    - Exceptions should be returned as Result<> object instead of throwing directly.
    - Each type of error should be represent by a unique class of Exception. This choice allows any kind of class of Exception containing any type of data in any structured be returned to exception handlers.
    - It must be defined clearly which layers will handle exceptions. Layers that emmit exception but does not handle them must pass them on in the form of Result<> object.
    - There are rare cases when directly throwing an exception is justifiable: these are when the exception are not recoverable, are impossible, and the programmers must prevent these exception from happening at all cost. These are exception caused by mis-using classes. So far, there's only one case (adding handler for MsgType.DEFAULT type in MsgHandlerContainer). No code is needed to catch these exception. Just make sure they don't happend.
