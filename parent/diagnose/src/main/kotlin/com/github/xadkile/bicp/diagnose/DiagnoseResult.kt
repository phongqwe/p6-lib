 * This should be an exception. That hold multiple exception, and give a clear picture of what is going?
 * It should be limited for each case:
 * - for example: in the case of starting kernel. There's just a limited set of exception that can be returned.
 * This class must somehow be good enough and clear enough for the user to pinpoint the problem.
 * This means it must be custom-tailored to each use case, and not an be-all-end-all class
